This C/C++ Linux Project will be an implementation-based network project which
consists of Network Socket Programming. The admin console will allow the user to see the practical implementation of the OSI Model.
The main purpose of this software is that one can mimic the network topology and make a Network Emulator build desired networks before implementing them in real life, Architecture, and Design of Network Application and TCP/IP Stack. The developer of the course will be creating nodes, links connecting nodes, configuring network parameters on nodes, sending and receiving traffic streams.
I’ve used Graph data structure for the building of topologies and Djikstra’s Algorithm to make, update and dump the Routing table.
